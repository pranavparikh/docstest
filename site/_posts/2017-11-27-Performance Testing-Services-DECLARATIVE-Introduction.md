### **Summary**

Our Performance Testing solution, based on JMeter, was developed in-house and built entirely from open source components. It enables engineers to execute performance tests on their own, without any dependencies. The user is able to monitor the test in Real Time, while the test is running, and at the end of the test get the Test Report over email; and it can also be integrated with Slack, to receive the Test Report on the dedicated Slack Channel. It allows engineers to build and modify tests quickly and easily, offering considerable time savings with minimal-to-none outside help.

### **Key Features**

*   Ability to run performance tests without performance engineering team involvement
*   No licensing or other third party costs involved, as the tool is build in-house from open source components
*   Estimated time-savings of 7 hours minimum of combined Performance+DevEngineer time for basic API tests
*   For existing tests, you can modify the API’s endpoint URL, Data Files, Workload Model etc. quickly and, easily
*   Readily observe and identify your project’s performance trends and plan accordingly
*   The Slack integration allows you to post the test reports on the dedicated channel
*   All Stats are in one place; easy to understand your app/api performance at a glance
*   Ability to monitor your test in Real Time, while the test is executing
*   All Infrastructure in on _cloud provider_ and it is easily scalable

### **Use Case**

**Testing a New or Existing API**

A developer wants to track the performance of an API call, a HTTP POST Method Call used to generate a promotional coupon as part of GOP - OneWalmart. They are interested in the following performance characteristics:

*   Response Time
*   Throughput

**Report**

*   Once the test is completed, a similar report will be generated and sent to the email provided during test execution
